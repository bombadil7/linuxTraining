# LINUX COMMAND NOTES

## Overview

This document covers variuos interesting points, specific commands and shortcuts, directory 
layout and file locations in Linux.  The point of this document is make it easier (or
even possible) to recall some information you once came across.

## Bash Highlights

Double quotes expand the variables, single quotes do not

Back tick allows inserting command inside a command:
    ~> cd /lib/modules/`uname -r`;pwd
        /lib/modules/4.10.0-21-generic



//***********************************************************************//
### History:
Search history for previous command:
    [Ctrl][r]  -  similar to [Ctrl][a] and [Ctrl][e] for beginning / end of line
        Enter will execute the command and Esc will add it to the command line rdy for editing.

    ~> history
    ~> !!       # recalls latest command
    ~> !1003    # recall command by its number
    ~> !-2      # recall second to last command
    ~> !cat     # recall latest command matching a starting string
    ~> !?search?    # search for a command that contains "search", but doesnt'
        start with it.  i.e. : "apt-cache search"

Make substitutions on the latest command:
    ~> ^more^less

Run another command with the same arguments:
    ~> more !*

Run another command with just the last one of the arguments:
    ~> chmod 766 ~/bin/extractTARs  # original command
    ~> ls !$:h

Can use word designator (:) to select arguments from prev. command:
    ~> ls /usr/share/doc/manpages
    ~> cd !!:1
In case where we are operating on the last command, can drop second ! and colon:
    ~> cd !1

First argument can be refered to as "^" and last as "$".
Ranges can be expressed as (prev command with all args):
    ~> !!:1*
    ~> !!:1-$
    ~> !!:*

Similarly, can use a number followed by "" to mean everything after specific word should 
be included.

"head" (h) can be used to select path leading up to the file (up to the final slash):
    ~> cat /usr/share/doc/manpages/copyright
    ~> cd !!:$:h
    ~> pwd
"tail" is designated by "t":
    ~> less !cat:$:t
"r" strips the trailing extension:
    ~> tar xzvf long-project-name.tgz
    ~> cd !!:$:r
or do it twice:
    ~> tar xzvf long-project-name.tar.gz
    ~> cd !!:$:r:r
"e" removes everything except the trailing extension
"p" echos the command instead of executing it (good for checking if substitution is correct):
    ~> find ~ -name "file1" # original command
    ~> !119:0:p / !119:2*:p
    ~> find / -name "file1" 
It also puts this modified command into history:
    [CTRL][p]

Easier substitutions could be done with s/original/new/ syntax:
    ~> !119:s/~/\//     # substitute first instance, or:
    ~> !119:s/~/\//g    # substitute in all occurances

To expand a command from history and see what was actually executed use Esc and then CTRL-e:
    ~> !!   # press Esc, followed by CTRL-e and you get:
    find / -name "swapfile"

Move through history:
    [Ctrl][p] - previous
    [Ctrl][n] - next

Move to the previous folder:
    ~> cd -

Recalling previous command after you already started typing it:
    ~> cmd
    CTRL-a
    CTRL-r
    CTRL-y
    CTRL-r
    or symply: CTRL-aryr

Another command for executing commands from history:
    fc -2 0     # Execute last two commands.  It will open those commands in vi for editing
                # and execute them when you exit


Alternative editors: nedit, gedit

### Archiving

- z       - gzip
- j       - bzip2
- J       - xz
- --lzma  - lzma
- c       - create
- t       - test
- x       - extract

examples:
```
~> tar jcvf archive.tar.bz2 dir
~> tar Jcvf archive.tar.xz dir
~> tar --lzma -cvf archive.tar.lzma
~> tar xvf archive.tar.[gz|bz2|lzma|xz]
```
Can exclude folders:
```
~> cd /folder_to_backup
~> tar czvf /backup/filename.tgz --exclude=folder/sub1 --exclude=folder/sub2 folder 
```
Note: `--exclude` statements MUST precede the source folder from which we want to exclude 
selected content.  Excluded folders must not have `~/` (full path works) , just what's 
recognizable from the source folder (pattern).  Folder name in the pattern can't have a 
trailing slash: `sys`  not `sys/`.  But `sys/*` would also work.
Examples:
```
tar -czvf test.tgz --exclude=work/intrinsyc work | tee testTar.log
tar -czvf test.tgz --exclude=work/intrinsyc ~/work 
tar -czvf test.tgz --exclude=/home/andrei/work/intrinsyc ~/work
tar -czvf test.tgz --exclude=intrinsyc ~/work       // no path, just the name of the folder
tar -czvf test.tgz --exclude='intrinsyc/*' ~/work   // 
```

Not:
```
tar -czvf test.tgz --exclude=work/intrinsyc/ ~/work     !!! trailing / after intrinsyc
tar -czvf test.tgz --exclude=~/work/intrinsyc ~/work    !!! ~/ before work
```

Use --exclude-from=<files2exclude>    or  -X <files2exclude>
Here <files2exclude> is a text file containing patterns:
intrinsyc

Good example:
$ for i in 0 1 2; do mkdir -p /tmp/data/sub$i; echo foo > /tmp/data/sub$i/foo; done
$ find /tmp/data
/tmp/data
/tmp/data/sub2
/tmp/data/sub2/foo
/tmp/data/sub0
/tmp/data/sub0/foo
/tmp/data/sub1
/tmp/data/sub1/foo
$ tar -czvf /tmp/_data.tgz --exclude='/tmp/data/sub[1-2]' /tmp/data 
tar: Removing leading `/' from member names
/tmp/data/
/tmp/data/sub0/
/tmp/data/sub0/foo

Zip Archives:
    ~> zip -r archive.zip <files>   # create
    ~> unzip -t archive.zip         # test / list
    ~> unzip archive.zip            # extract

Look into rsync (remote sync)!!!

VIM:
Run shell command from inside VIM:
    :!{cmd}

    :! By itself, runs the last external command (from your shell history)
    :!! Repeats the last command
    :silent !{cmd} Eliminates the need to hit enter after the command is done
    :r !{cmd} Puts the output of $cmd into the current buffer

Dot character means "perform last command again", so to comment out several lines in Bash
script you would comment out one, and then go j.j.j.j.  

can use a marker for the first line: ma     "where a is any letter
then move to the last line and run:  :'a,. s/^/#/
This works just like running s/^/#/ on a visual selection. Here 'a is the designates
the mark and . designates current line, separated by a comma (,).

Assigned (,"), (,//), (,#) and (,;) to create comments (pick one depending on your
language) when visual block is selected.  
To clear the comments select the visual block again and run ",cl".  It works for all langs.

To search available installation packages use apt-cache search, for instance to 
search for "nvidia settins" type:
    ~> apt-cache search nvidia settings
The output is:
    nvidia-settings - Werkzeug fÃ¼r die Konfiguration des NVIDIA-Grafiktreibers
    nvidia-settings-updates - Tool of configuring the NVIDIA graphics driver
To find the binary related to the package "nvidia-settings" run:
    ~> dpkg -L nvidia-settins | grep bin
The output is:
    /usr/bin
    /usr/lib/nvidia-settings/bin
    /usr/lib/nvidia-settings/bin/nvidia-settings

Use tee command to send standard output to the screen and to the file sumultaneously (fork):
    ~> make | tee build.log
    ~> make install | tee -a build.log

Fill standard input with always the same string:
    ~> yes <string> | <command> # <string> is y by default
examples:
    ~> yes | rm -r dir/
    bank> yes no | credit_applicant
    ~> yes "" | make oldconfig  # equivalent to hitting "Enter" to accept all default settings


gz:      2.412s     74,155,976
bz2:    10.304s     73,710,049 
xz:     25.109s     68,475,888
lzma:   25.752s     68.475,888 

To search for files with certain permission:
find /path/to/file -user user1 -perm -u+rwx

Or using grep to extract all files with superuser bit set:
ls /usr/bin | grep '^...s'

We can use this grep filter to print only the file names:
ls /usr/bin | grep '^...s' | awk '{ print $9 }'

Makefiles:  each variable in the Makefile can be overridden from command line.  When SRCS

To fix missing dependencies issue run:
apt --fix-broken install

Configure git to properly handle line endings (avoid ^M endings):
~> git config --global core.autocrlf input

Error installing gvim after building it from source:
~> sudo checkinstall
dpkg: error processing archive /blah/blah/vim_ddd.dev
    trying to overwrite '/usr/bin/xxd'
dpkg-dev: error: subprocess paste was killed by signal (Broken pipe)
Errors were encountered while processing:
    /home/bombadil/tmp/vim/vim_20170611-1_amd64.deb

Fix it with this command:
~> sudo dpkg -i --force-overwrite /home/bombadil/tmp/vim/vim_20170611-1_amd64.deb
Then check with 
~> sudo apt-get -f install
And reinstall:
~> sudo checkinstall
May be able to install simply with:
~> sudo apt install -f  # haven't tried it
Can remove the package again with:
~> dpkg -r vim

When having problems with Windows endings in a file ( ^M ) open file with vim and run:
:set fileformat=unix
Also can use dos2unix -n fileName newFileName



#***********************************************************************************
# Linux Libraries
#
Headers are located in 

/usr/include

Check out /usr/include/SDL2,  /usr/include/GL

Dynamic libraries can be found in 
/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu

*.a corresponds to archive libraries, which are statically linked with -c flag
*.so extensions indicate shared object libraries, which are linked dynamically

Look at:
/usr/lib/x86.../libGLU.a
                libGLU.so
                libglut.so
                libGL.so
                
Compiling and linking can be done this way when #including <GL/gl.h> and <SDL2/SDL.h>:

~> gcc -Wall -Wextra -pedantic -c sdlGL.c -o sdlGL.o
~> gcc sdlGL.o -o sdlGLtest1 `sdl-config --libs --cflags` -lm -lGL -lSDL2
~> ls
sdlGL.c  sdlGL.o  sdlGLtest1
